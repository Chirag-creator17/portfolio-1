# About
Hey everyone, I'm Chirag Goel, Freshman at MAIT CSE. Passionate about computers, tech savvy, love interacting with new people.
I am currently working my way up to become a great competitive coder, learning, understanding and strengthening.
Apart from CP ,I'm always looking for something new or creating some project that are more creative and reliable for the user.
